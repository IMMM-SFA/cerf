    abstract = {The future development of the U.S. electricity sector will be shaped by technological, economic, and policy drivers whose trajectories are highly uncertain. In this article, we develop an optimization model for the integrated generation and transmission system in the continental U.S. and use it to explore electricity infrastructure pathways from the present through 2050. By comparing and contrasting results from numerous scenarios and sensitivity settings, we ultimately affirm five key policy-relevant insights. (1) U.S. electricity can be substantially decarbonized at modest cost, but complete decarbonization is very costly. (2) Significant expansion of solar PV and wind to combine for at least 40% of the generation mix by 2050 is fairly certain, although solar PV and battery storage are more affected by economic and policy assumptions than wind. (3) Investments in long-distance transmission are very limited, while investments in battery storage are much greater, under a wide range of assumptions. (4) Optimal solutions include large investments in natural gas capacity, but gas capacity utilization rates decline steadily and significantly. (5) Cost structures shift away from operating expenditures and toward capital expenditures, especially under climate policy. We conclude our article by discussing the policy implications of these findings.}
