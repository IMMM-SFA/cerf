    "## A brief introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Capacity Expansion Regional Feasibility package (`cerf`) helps us evaluate the feasibility and structure of future electricity capacity expansion plans by siting power plants in areas that have been deemed the least cost option.  We can use `cerf` to gain an understanding of topics such as:  1) whether or not future projected electricity expansion plans from models such as GCAM are possible to achieve, 2) where suitability (e.g., cooling water availability) may influence our ability to achieve certain expansions, and/or 3) how power plant infrastructure build outs and value may evolve into the future when considering locational marginal pricing from a grid operations model.\n",
    "\n",
    "`cerf` currently operates at a 1 km<sup>2</sup> resolution over the conterminous United States.  Each grid cell is given an initial value of suitable (0) or unsuitable (1) based on a collection of suitability criteria gleaned from the literature.  `cerf`'s default suitability layers include both those that are common to all thermal technologies as well as technology-specific suitability criteria.  Common suitability layers represent categories such as protected lands, critical habitat areas, and much more.  Technology-specific suitability layers are those that satisfy requirements that may not be applicable to all technologies.  An example would be minimum mean annual flow requirements for cooling water availability for individual thermal technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce a metric named **Net Locational Cost (NLC)** that is used compete power plant technologies for each grid cell based on the least expensive option.  NLC is calculated by subtracting the Net Operational Value (NOV) of the proposed power plant from the cost of its interconnection to the grid to represent the potential deployment value.  Both the NOV parameter which incorporates many technology-specific values such as variable operations and maintenance costs, carbon price, heat rate, etc. and the interconnection cost parameter used for both electricity transmission and gas pipelines have variables that are accessible to the user for modification per time step.\n"

    "We will be exploring the main functionality of the `cerf` package using our built-in data which is meant for illustrative purposes only.  `cerf` runs using a single YAML configuration file that contains project and technology-specific settings, an electricity capacity expansion plan, and lmp zones pricing data which is described in detail in the docs [here](https://immm-sfa.github.io/cerf/).  Expansion plans and technology data are generally generated by models such as GCAM-USA which capture multi-sector dynamics that represent alternate futures based on scenario assumptions for socioeconomics, radiative forcing, etc. The `cerf` package also utilizes power plant siting suitability data at a 1km resolution over the CONUS, publically available data from EIA and HIFLD for transmission and pipeline infrastructure, and 8760 locational marginal pricing from your prefered grid operations model.\n"
