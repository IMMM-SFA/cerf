**cerf** is an open-source geospatial Python package for evaluating and analyzing future electricity technology capacity expansion feasibility.  **cerf** was created to evaluate the on-the-ground siting feasibility of an electricity system expansion plan by:

1) Translating a capacity expansion plan into individually sited renewable and non-renewable power plants across a region.

2) Emulating regional practices that address local congestion and interconnection costs as well as the social, land, and policy-based constraints faced by developers. 

3) Providing a flexible and computationally efficient tool to understand the relative importance of different factors affecting the feasibility of siting new infrastructure, such as energy justice, land suitability, water availability, and emissions.
